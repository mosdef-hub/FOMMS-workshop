    "\n",
    "The Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF) is a collection of open-source tools ([hosted on Github](https://github.com/mosdef-hub)) aimed at facilitating the construction and simulation of complex molecular systems - with a particular focus on the automated screening of large structural parameter spaces. All tools are written as Python packages and feature a Python-based API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MoSDeF software suite consist of three core libraries, namely [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild.git), [Foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer.git), and [GMSO](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/gmso.git). Each library dedicates to handle a certain step of the chemical system initialization process, as summarized in the figure below.\n",

    "[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provide an interactive environment for \"developing, documenting, and executing code\". Several languages are supported; however here we will be using Python. \n",

    "Cells do not have to be executed in order (however the cells in this tutorial are designed to be executed sequentially), and the order in which cells have been executed is recorded by the bracketed number to the left of the code cell (e.g. [ 1 ]). When a cell is executed you will first see an asterisk (i.e. [ * ]) which means that the cell is still running. When the asterisk is replaced by a number this means the execution has completed."

The library can be used to create anything between a particle/molecule and a complex systems with multiple components. Moreover, mBuild also supports creation of systems from pre-defined files (`xyz`, `pdb`, `mol2`, `top`, `gro`, etc.,) and [SMILES string](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html), allow easy-setup for multiple types of systems.\n",

This can be achieved through the process of graph matching. The atomtype's rules can be specified through [SMARTS](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html) string, which can be compared with the bond network of the system of interest. By automating the process of atomtyping (or graph matching), `Foyer` removed unncessary human interations, which may lead to unwanted, irreproducible errors. \n",

    "This workshop might not have enough time for us to go through all the features offered by the MoSDeF software suites. For the next hour, we will try give a brief introduction about some basic feature, and their underlying logic of each package. With that knowledge, we will all try to construct a simple system, perform atomtyping and then run a short simulations."
