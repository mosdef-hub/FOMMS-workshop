    "## Classical Force Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical force fields, which describe the interaction between atoms, typically contain numerous fitting parameters (e.g., Lennard-Jones sigma and epsilon, partial charge), allowing them to be tuned to describe the behavior of atoms in various chemical environments (i.e., `chemical context`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider carbon in various local bonded environments of the following, along with their fitting parameters for OPLS (units, epsilon: kJ/mol, sigma: nm, charge: multiple of electron charge): \n",
    "\n",
    "- #### A terminal methyl group in an alkane, i.e., C-CH3\n",
    "    * opls_135\n",
    "    * charge=-0.18\n",
    "    * sigma=0.35 \n",
    "    * epsilon=0.276144\n",
    "- #### A terminal fluorinated methyl group, i.e., C-CF3\n",
    "    * opls_961\n",
    "    * charge=0.36\n",
    "    * sigma=0.35  \n",
    "    * epsilon=0.276144\n",
    "- #### As a terminal group in an alkene, i.e., C=CH2\n",
    "    * opls_143\n",
    "    * charge=-0.23\n",
    "    * sigma=0.355\n",
    "    * epsilon=0.317984\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the element does not change (i.e., we are dealing with carbon in each case), the force field fitting parameters are different for OPLS (and would be for many other common force fields).  As such, force field databases may contain 10s or 100s of parameters for a given element, where each unique set of parameters is referred to as an 'atom-type'; i.e., defining the element in a different `chemical context`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly determining the correct set of parameters for a given element (i.e., identifying which atom-type should be used), can be a difficult and error-prone task, but essential for the final results of a simulation to be correct.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Foyer has been developed as both a scheme to encode these rules for atom-typing along with a software that evaluates these rules. Here we will first focus on the scheme to encode rules and the associated file format. \n",

    "- `opls_135` and `opls_136` would also evaulate to `True`.  \n",
    "    * In the case of `opls_135`, our definition only states that at least 3 of the neighbors are hydrogen, and have not made any specific claims about the identity of the 4th neighbor.\n",

    "#### Notes: \n",
    "* Foyer will evaluate all the rules in a forcefield file, rather than just stopping at the first rule that evaluates to `True`\n",
    "    * This allows rules to be defined in any order\n",
    "* Foyer iterates over the rules (iterating until no changes our found)\n",
    "    * This allows recursive definitions of usage, i.e., referring to specific atom-types in the SMARTS string, as will be discussed later \n",

    "### `overrides`  \n",
    "`overrides` provide a means to dictate rule precedence (i.e., which rules are more specific than others).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the force field file above, `opls_138` has defined: `overrides=\"opls_135,opls_136\"`:  \n",
    " * That is, if `opls_138` evaluates to `True`, then it takes precedence over `opls_135` and `opls_136`, even if they evaluate to `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if opls_135 evaluates to `True`, it `overrides=\"opls_136\"`, because opls_135 is more specific, thus taking precedence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### More specific SMARTS definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursive definitions \n",
    "`overrides` are especially useful if the chemical context of two different atom-types are effectively the same.  E.g., the terminal methyl group in an alkane has the same first neighbor environment as the methyl group in toluene, however the parameters (and thus atom-type) are different. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus `overrides` can be used to state that if the more specific toluene rule evaluates to `True` it should take precedences over the more general alkane rule. Also note that in the SMARTS for toluene, we use a recursive definition.  That is, we use an atom-type name in addition to the element, i.e., `[C;X4](C;%opls_145)(H)(H)H`.  This states that the carbon we are connected to must be opls_145 to evaluate to true.  We can use these recursive definitions because atom-typing is performed as an iterative process in Foyer. Obviously, if we use recursive definitions for all of our SMARTS, we will not be able to atom-type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../graphics/ch3-toluene.png\" alt=\"toluene\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Longer range patterns\n",
    "In many cases, recursive definitions can be avoided by providing more specific SMARTS strings.  For example, we could instead take note of the fact that opls_145 only has 3 connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[C;X4](C;X3)(H)(H)H`\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also state the identify of those connections if necessary (or even define then entire opls_145 SMARTS pattern, `[C;X3;r6]1[C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6]1`), although the larger definitions may begine to be less clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often times more specific definitions can remove the need to define `overrides`.  For example, the rules for `opls_135`, `opls_136`, and `opls_138` above can be made more specific by stating the identify of the other neighbors and thus eliminate the need for `overrides`, as shown below.  It is important to note that some force fields are designed such to have \"generic\" parameters that we would default to if more specific cases are not available. \n",
