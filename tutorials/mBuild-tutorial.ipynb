In this tutorial we will explore some of mBuild's basic functionality by constructing a linear alkane chain. We'll then examine how mBuild's component-based design approach allows components to be easily swapped to facilitate structural screening.\n",

Molecules are constructed hierarchically; however, each level of the hierarchy inherits from the `Compound` class.

There are several ways to interrogate what is contained within a `Compound` (e.g. `type`, `dir`, `list`). mBuild `Compounds` feature [a variety of useful methods and attributes](https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/stable/topic_guides/data_structures.html#) to facilitate system construction.\n",

This aids in the atomtyping and forcefield application process (using the Foyer package) which we will get back to later.\n",
